Write a SQL query to delete all duplicate email entries in a table named Person, keeping only unique emails based on its smallest Id.
+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+

Id is the primary key column for this table.
For example, after running your query, the above Person table should have the following rows:
+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+



Then we need to find the bigger id having same email address with other records. So we can add a new condition to the WHERE clause like this.
```
delete p1 
    from Person as p1, Person as p2
    where p1.Email = p2.Email and p1.Id > p2.Id
```
