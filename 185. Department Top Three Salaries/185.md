The Employee table holds all employees. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the department Id.
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | DepartmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 1            |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
| 5  | Janet | 69000  | 1            |
| 6  | Randy | 85000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+

The Department table holds all departments of the company.
+----+----------+
| Id | Name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | IT       |
| 2  | Sales    |
+----+----------+

Write a SQL query to find employees who earn the top three salaries in each of the department. For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows.
+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Randy    | 85000  |
| IT         | Joe      | 70000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |
+------------+----------+--------+

## Approach I
A top 3 salary in this company means there is no more than 3 salary bigger than itself in the company.
```
select e1.Name as 'Employee', e1.Salary
    from Employee as e1
    where 3 >
    (
        select count(distinct e2.Salary)
            from Employee e2
            where e2.Salary > e1.Salary
    )
;
```

In this code, we count the salary number of which is bigger than e1.Salary. So the output is as below for the sample data.
| Employee | Salary |
|----------|--------|
| Henry    | 80000  |
| Max      | 90000  |
| Randy    | 85000  |
Then, we need to join the Employee table with Department in order to retrieve the department information.

```
select d.name as 'Department', e.name as 'Employee', e.Salary
    from Employee as e inner join Department as d
    on e.DepartmentId = d.Id
    where (
        select count(distinct ee.Salary)
            from Employee as ee
            where ee.Salary > e.Salary and ee.DepartmentId = e.DepartmentId
        ) < 3
```

## Approach II
```
select D.Name as Department, E.Name as Employee, E.Salary as Salary 
    from Employee E, Department D
    where (
        select count(distinct(Salary)) from Employee 
            where DepartmentId = E.DepartmentId and Salary > E.Salary) in (0, 1, 2)
    and 
        E.DepartmentId = D.Id 
    order by E.DepartmentId, E.Salary DESC;
```
