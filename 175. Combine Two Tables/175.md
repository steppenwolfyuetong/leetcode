+-------------+---------+

| PersonId    | int     |

* Write a SQL query for a report that provides the following information for each person in the Person table, regardless if there is an address for each of those people:
`FirstName, LastName, City, State`

1. Address.PersonId是Person的外键
2. 由于无论每个Person是否有Address都要返回，因此要用外联结

```
select FirstName, LastName, City, State
    from Person left outer join Address
    on Person.PersonId = Address.PersonId
```
