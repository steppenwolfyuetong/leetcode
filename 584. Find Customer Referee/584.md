Given a table customer holding customers information and the referee.
+------+------+-----------+
| id   | name | referee_id|
+------+------+-----------+
|    1 | Will |      NULL |
|    2 | Jane |      NULL |
|    3 | Alex |         2 |
|    4 | Bill |      NULL |
|    5 | Zack |         1 |
|    6 | Mark |         2 |
+------+------+-----------+

Write a query to return the list of customers NOT referred by the person with id '2'.
For the sample data above, the result is:
+------+
| name |
+------+
| Will |
| Jane |
| Bill |
| Zack |
+------+

Some people come out the following solution by intuition.
```
SELECT name FROM customer WHERE referee_Id <> 2;
```

However, this query will only return one result:Zack although there are 4 customers not referred by Jane (including Jane herself). All the customers who were referred by nobody at all (NULL value in the referee_id column) don’t show up. But why?

MySQL uses three-valued logic -- TRUE, FALSE and UNKNOWN. Anything compared to NULL evaluates to the third value: UNKNOWN. That “anything” includes NULL itself! That’s why MySQL provides the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators to specifically check for NULL.

Thus, one more condition 'referee_id IS NULL' should be added to the WHERE clause as below.
```
SELECT name FROM customer WHERE referee_id != 2 OR referee_id IS NULL;
```

一定要用is null和is not null, 而不是= null或者!= null
