Given a table tree, id is identifier of the tree node and p_id is its parent node's id.
+----+------+
| id | p_id |
+----+------+
| 1  | null |
| 2  | 1    |
| 3  | 1    |
| 4  | 2    |
| 5  | 2    |
+----+------+

Each node in the tree can be one of three types:
Leaf: if the node is a leaf node.
Root: if the node is the root of the tree.
Inner: If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.

Write a query to print the node id and the type of the node. Sort your output by the node id. The result for the above sample is:
+----+------+
| id | Type |
+----+------+
| 1  | Root |
| 2  | Inner|
| 3  | Leaf |
| 4  | Leaf |
| 5  | Leaf |
+----+------+

Explanation
Node '1' is root node, because its parent node is NULL and it has child node '2' and '3'.
Node '2' is inner node, because it has parent node '1' and child node '4' and '5'.
Node '3', '4' and '5' is Leaf node, because they have parent node and they don't have child node.

# Approach I
1. Root
```
select id, 'Root' as Type 
from tree
where id p_id is null
```

2. Leaf
```
select id, 'Leaf' as Type
    from tree
    where id not in 
    (
        select distinct id from tree 
        where p_id is not null
    )
    and p_id is not null
```

3. Inner
```
select id, 'Inner' as Type
    from tree
    where id in 
    (
        select distinct id from tree 
        where p_id is not null
    )
    and p_id is not null
```

```
Root
    union
Leaf
    union
Inner
```

# Approach II
select 
    id as 'Id',
    case
        when tree.id = (select tree1.id from tree as tree1 where tree1.p_id is null)
            then 'Root'
        when tree.id in (select tree2.p_id from tree as tree2)
            then 'Inner'
        else
            'Leaf'
    end as Type
from tree
order by 'Id'
;

# Approach III
select
    id,
    if(isnull(p_id), 'Root', if(id in (select p_id from tree), 'Inner', 'Leaf')) as Type
from
    tree
order by id
