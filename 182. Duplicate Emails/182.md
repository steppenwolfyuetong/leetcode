Write a SQL query to find all duplicate emails in a table named Person.

+----+---------+
| Id | Email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+
For example, your query should return the following for the above table:

+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+
Note: All emails are in lowercase.


* 内联结 需要加distinct
* 否则在例子中Id为1和3的Email相同，返回两行
```
select distinct a.Email as 'Email'
    from Person as a inner join Person as b
    on a.Email = b.Email and a.Id != b.Id
```

* 参考答案1
Duplicated emails existed more than one time. To count the times each email exists, we can use the following code.

```
select Email, count(Email) as num
    from Person
    group by Email;
```

| Email   | num |
|---------|-----|
| a@b.com | 2   |
| c@d.com | 1   |

Taking this as a temporary table, we can get a solution as below.
```
select Email from
(
  select Email, count(Email) as num
  from Person
  group by Email
) as statistic
where num > 1
;
```

A more common used way to add a condition to a GROUP BY is to use the HAVING clause, which is much simpler and more efficient.
So we can rewrite the above solution to this one.

```
select Email
    from Person
    group by Email
    having count(Email) > 1;
```
