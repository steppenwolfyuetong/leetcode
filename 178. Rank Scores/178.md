Write a SQL query to rank scores. If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. Note that after a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no "holes" between ranks.

+----+-------+
| Id | Score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+
For example, given the above Scores table, your query should generate the following report (order by highest score):

+-------+------+
| Score | Rank |
+-------+------+
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 3.85  | 2    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.50  | 4    |
+-------+------+

* distinct Score: 
4.00
3.85
3.65
3.50

```
select Score, (select count(distinct Score) from Scores where Score >= s.Score) as Rank
    from Scores as s
    order by Score desc
```

```
SELECT
    Score,
    (
        SELECT count(*) 
            FROM (SELECT distinct Score s FROM Scores) as temp
            WHERE s >= Score
    ) as Rank
FROM Scores
ORDER BY Score desc
```

```
select Scores.Score, count(ranking.Score)
    from Scores, (select distinct Score from Scores) as Ranking
    where Scores.Score <= Ranking.Score
group by Scores.Id, Scores.Score
order by Scores.Score desc;
```
