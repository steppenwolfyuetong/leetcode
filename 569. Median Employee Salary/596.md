The Employee table holds all employees. The employee table has three columns: Employee Id, Company Name, and Salary.
+-----+------------+--------+
|Id   | Company    | Salary |
+-----+------------+--------+
|1    | A          | 2341   |
|2    | A          | 341    |
|3    | A          | 15     |
|4    | A          | 15314  |
|5    | A          | 451    |
|6    | A          | 513    |
|7    | B          | 15     |

Write a SQL query to find the median salary of each company. Bonus points if you can solve it without using any built-in SQL functions.

Approach #1: Using the definition of median [Accepted]

By the definition of median, the count of the bigger numbers than itself should be equal to the count of the smaller ones in an odd array.

Take array [1,3,2] for example, is the first number 1 the median? No, because this array only have 3 elements but there are 2 of them (3, 2) are greater than 1. To continue, we know 3 is not the median as well since there are 2 elements smaller. But for the last element 2, there are equal amount of bigger and smaller numbers. So it is the median in this array!

What if an array has even amount of distinct values, the median is the average of the middle two elements next to each other after sorting this array. It is not hard to understand that for either of these two elements, the difference (absolute value) of its bigger and smaller number than itself in this array is 1, which is the exactly frequency of a element in the distinct array.

So in general, the median's frequency should be equal or grater than the absolute difference of its bigger elements and small ones in an array no matter whether it has odd or even amount of numbers and whether they are distinct. This rule is the key, and it is represented as the following code.

```
SUM(CASE
    WHEN Employee.Salary = alias.Salary THEN 1
    ELSE 0
END) >= ABS(SUM(SIGN(Employee.Salary - alias.Salary)))
```
Thus, this approach is as following in MySQL code.

```
SELECT
    Employee.Id, Employee.Company, Employee.Salary
FROM
    Employee,
    Employee alias
WHERE
    Employee.Company = alias.Company
GROUP BY Employee.Company , Employee.Salary
HAVING SUM(CASE
    WHEN Employee.Salary = alias.Salary THEN 1
    ELSE 0
END) >= ABS(SUM(SIGN(Employee.Salary - alias.Salary)))
ORDER BY Employee.Id
;
```
