The Employee table holds all employees. Every employee has an Id, a salary, and there is also a column for the department Id.
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | DepartmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 1            |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+

The Department table holds all departments of the company.
+----+----------+
| Id | Name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | IT       |
| 2  | Sales    |
+----+----------+

Write a SQL query to find employees who have the highest salary in each of the departments. For the above tables, Max has the highest salary in the IT department and Henry has the highest salary in the Sales department.
+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
+------------+----------+--------+


Since the Employee table contains the Salary and DepartmentId information, we can query the highest salary in a department.
```
SELECT
    DepartmentId, MAX(Salary)
FROM
    Employee
GROUP BY DepartmentId;
```
| DepartmentId | MAX(Salary) |
|--------------|-------------|
| 1            | 90000       |
| 2            | 80000       |

Then, we can join table Employee and Department, and query the (DepartmentId, Salary) are in the temp table using IN statement as below.

```
select Department.Name as 'Department', Employee.Name as 'Employee', Salary
    from Employee inner join Department
    ON Employee.DepartmentId = Department.Id
    where
        (Employee.DepartmentId, Salary) in
        (
            SELECT
                DepartmentId, MAX(Salary)
            FROM
                Employee
            GROUP BY DepartmentId
        )
```
